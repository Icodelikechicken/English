"Do you think you have a healthy lifestyle"

This year, I lost my goals and became quite lazy. However, recently I have tried to build a healthier lifestyle. Luckily, I found Chat-GPT, and it helps me like a teacher, a mentor who guides me to a better future.

"What do you do to stay healthy?"

I am stopping myself from eating or drinking anything that has sugar. I also started exercises again after a long break. I cook my own meals because I think fastfood is not good for my health. I don't go out unless it is necessary because the air in my city is very polluted.

"Is exercise important in your daily life?"

Exercise is very impotant part in my daily life. I used to work out every day, and, at that time, I felt strong, healthy and full of energy. But this year, I stopped doing exercise, and I had more headache, flu, and stress. That is why I decided to take care of my health again.
